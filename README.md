# csai-datagathering

This repository tracks the progress of data generation and enhancement for the USDOT Complete Streets Artificial Intelligence (CSAI) Initiative — Phase I. The goal is to generate geospatial datasets across three key categories: **Infrastructure**, **Traveler Behavior/Safety**, and **Context**, to support decision-making tools for multimodal transportation planning.

📍 **Phase I Goal:** Generate data layers covering a geographic area of at least 250,000 people, incorporating the widest possible set of elements from Table 2.

## ✅ Progress Checklist: Table 2 Data Elements

### 🛣️ Infrastructure
Data elements to generate or enhance:
- [ ] Roadway features
  - [ ] Centerline roadway network
  - [ ] Travel direction, number of lanes, lane markings and widths, shoulder width, edge condition barriers, guardrails.
  - [ ] Mid-block, intersection-approach, and through-intersection conditions (turn radii, turn lanes, intersection markings,
intersection format e.g., T, X, multi-leg, roundabout)
- [ ] Signals, markings, signs (including posted speed limits)
- [ ] Signal timing and phasing
- [ ] Sidewalks, crosswalks, driveways, curb ramps, medians, refuges, curb extensions
- [ ] Transit stop accessibility (ADA) features (ramp deployment clear space, tactile warning strips)
- [ ] Bicycle facilities and facility type (unmarked, unseparated, and separated facilities; intersection-approach and through-intersection treatments)
- [x] Speed management countermeasures (speed humps, speed tables, raised intersections) Note: We are considering speed humps and speed tables as the same data for NYC.
- [ ] Sidewalk surface condition (roughness, cracking, heaving)
- [ ] Fixed obstructions within pedestrian and bicycle facilities (utility poles, signposts)
- [ ] On-street curb management (parking, loading, and delivery, including freight)
- [ ] Multi-use paths and traversable public open spaces

Generally available data:
- [ ] Transit stops and routes
- [ ] Rail routes and crossings

### 🚶 Traveler Behavior / Safety
Data elements to generate or enhance:
- [ ] Vehicle volumes and types (cars, trucks, freight, other)
- [ ] Vehicle operating speeds and speed distributions
- [x] **WIP (Sonia)** Injuries, injury severity, and near misses
- [ ] Bicycle and pedestrian user and/or trip counts
- [ ] Transit ridership

Generally available data:
- [x] **WIP (Sonia)** Crash data (fatalities, location, crash rate, roadway classification and contexts, and crash severity)
---

### 🌆 Context
Data elements to generate or enhance:
- [ ] Land use (residential, commercial, industrial, civic, academic, mixed-use)
• Tree cover/landscaping (including shade)
• Urban design/frontage (including adjacent site design and building setback)

Generally available data:
- [ ] Key destinations (healthcare, academic, civic, employment, retail-commercial, recreation)
- [ ] Housing and employment density
- [ ] Environment (surface heat index, green space, open space)
- [ ] Social determinants of health
- [x] **WIP (Sonia)** Socio-economic and demographic data
- [ ] Environmental Justice and transportation disadvantaged communities
- [ ] Topography
- [ ] Designated goods movement (freight) routes
