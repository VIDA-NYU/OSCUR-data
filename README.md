This repository tracks the progress of data generation and enhancement for the `USDOT Complete Streets Artificial Intelligence` (CSAI) Initiative — Phase I. The goal is to generate geospatial datasets across three key categories: **Infrastructure**, **Traveler Behavior/Safety**, and **Context**, to support decision-making tools for multimodal transportation planning.

📍 **Phase I Goal:** Generate data layers covering a geographic area of at least 250,000 people, incorporating the widest possible set of elements from Table 2. For detailed progress tracking, refer to the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/csai-datagathering/issues/1).

🤗 All datasets uploaded are available on our **[HuggingFace Hub](https://huggingface.co/oscur)**.  

## 🚀 Getting Started

- **Dataset Uploads:** To upload datasets to the `HuggingFace Hub`, follow the instructions in [upload_to_hugging_face/README.md](upload_to_hugging_face/README.md).
- **Dataset Format:** Use the provided [dataset_script_template.py](dataset_script_template.py) as a starting point for structuring datasets compatible with HuggingFace’s `datasets` library.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions to enhance the dataset collection and improve the tools! Please:
- Check the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/csai-datagathering/issues/1) for current progress and to avoid duplicating efforts.
- Submit pull requests with new datasets, scripts, or documentation updates.
