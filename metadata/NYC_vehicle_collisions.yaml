"description": "The Motor Vehicle Collisions crash table contains details on the crash\
  \ event. Each row represents a crash event. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables\
  \ contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC.\
  \ The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where\
  \ someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage\
  \ (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf).\
  \  It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the\
  \ MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.For the most accurate,\
  \ up to date statistics on traffic fatalities, please refer to the <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/traffic-data/traffic-data-collision.page\"\
  \ style=\"color:#187bcd;\">NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions page</a> (updated weekly)\
  \ or <a href=\"http://www.nycvzv.info/\" style=\"color:#187bcd;\">Vision Zero View</a>\
  \ (updated monthly).\r\n\r\n</p>\r\nDue to success of the CompStat program, NYPD\
  \ began to ask how to apply the CompStat principles  to other problems.  Other than\
  \ homicides, the fatal incidents with which police have the most contact with the\
  \ public are fatal traffic collisions.  Therefore in April 1998, the Department\
  \ implemented TrafficStat, which uses the CompStat model to work towards improving\
  \ traffic safety.  Police officers complete form MV-104AN  for all vehicle collisions.\
  \  The MV-104AN is a New York State form that has all of the details of a traffic\
  \ collision.  Before implementing Trafficstat, there was no uniform traffic safety\
  \ data collection procedure for all of the NYPD precincts.  Therefore, the Police\
  \ Department implemented the Traffic Accident Management System (TAMS) in July 1999\
  \ in order to collect traffic data in a uniform method across the City.  TAMS required\
  \ the precincts manually enter a few selected MV-104AN fields to collect very basic\
  \ intersection traffic crash statistics which included the number of accidents,\
  \ injuries and fatalities. As the years progressed, there grew a need for additional\
  \ traffic data so that more detailed analyses could be conducted. The Citywide traffic\
  \ safety initiative, Vision Zero started in the year 2014.  Vision Zero further\
  \ emphasized the need for the collection of more traffic data in order to work towards\
  \ the Vision Zero goal, which is to eliminate traffic fatalities.  Therefore, the\
  \ Department in March 2016 replaced the TAMS with the new Finest Online Records\
  \ Management System (FORMS).  FORMS enables the police officers to electronically,\
  \ using a Department cellphone or computer, enter all of the MV-104AN data fields\
  \ and stores all of the MV-104AN data fields in the Department\u2019s crime data\
  \ warehouse.  Since all of the MV-104AN data fields are now stored for each traffic\
  \ collision, detailed traffic safety analyses can be conducted as applicable."
