dataset_id: "signals_markings_signs"
name: "Signals, Signs, and Markings (NYC Combined)"
description: >
  A unified, deduplicated dataset combining key NYC DOT spatial sources:
  accessible pedestrian signal locations, street sign work orders, and traffic signal infrastructure.
  Each dataset is harmonized into point geometry, and duplicate feature IDs within each source are removed.
